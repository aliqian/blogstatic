Hello. This is the beginning. How exciting. I've always wanted to start a blog site. I know, procrastination is bad.

After slight struggle, I decide to focus on writing down what I learned each day, and trying to explain everything I thought I knew.

For example today I learned a concept called Feynman Technique, named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. It's a method for learning. The basic idea is to explain the concept you want to learn in plain, simple language.

1. Pick a concept. Write it down.
2. Explain it as much as you can.
3. Once get stuck, go to your material, check it out.
4. Check your explanation, replace any complex terms with simpler ones. Make sure someone without any background can understand.

It a good technique. But I wonder if it help with learning language. Because I don't think it's something you can "explain". When describe the 4 steps of using Feynman technique, there is something I want to say, but I don't know how to express it in English.

Since I'm not a master in English writing, I'll only use it once in a while, for practice purpose.

No more gibberish. See you soon.
